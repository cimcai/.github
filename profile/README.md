# Machine Consciousness

Advance our understanding of how intelligence and consciousness emerge across biological, artificial, and hybrid systems, to develop new technologies for the benefit of humanity and other sentient life.

## About CIMC

The **California Institute of Machine Consciousness (CIMC)** is an independent research institute created by Joscha Bach bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scientists, engineers, philosophers, and artists to study the fundamental building blocks of intelligence, agency, and consciousness—and the conditions under which they emerge.

Just as intelligence and mind arose through billions of years of physical, biological, and social evolution, we believe that embracing a **bottom-up, substrate-aware approach**—grounded in the physical, biological, and social sciences—will enable the development of more adaptive, efficient, and ethically grounded intelligent systems. CIMC focuses on intelligence not as a narrow software artifact, but as a **natural phenomenon spanning matter, computation, and collective organization**.

## Our Work

#### The California Institute of Machine Consciousness is focused on the paradigm shifts below… and others.

*Natural & living computation* — Computation existed in nature long before digital computers. CIMC develops theoretical and experimental frameworks for understanding life, intelligence, and agency as emergent properties of physical and biological systems. By studying morphogenesis, self-organization, and open-ended evolution, we seek general principles that explain how complexity, cooperation, and goal-directed behavior arise—and how these principles can inform the design of artificial and hybrid intelligences.

*Neural & substrate-aware computing* — Brains are computational systems, but they do not operate like classical computers. CIMC investigates alternative computational architectures inspired by biological nervous systems, emphasizing massive parallelism, local learning, energy efficiency, and continuous adaptation. Our work explores neuromorphic, analog, and thermodynamically grounded approaches that move beyond sequential instruction execution toward more lifelike forms of computation.

*Predictive & developmental intelligence* — Intelligence is fundamentally predictive: it consists in modeling the future—of the environment, of other agents, and of oneself—based on accumulated experience and feedback. CIMC studies intelligence as a developmental process rather than a static artifact, investigating systems that learn, reorganize, and evolve continuously. This blurs traditional distinctions between training, deployment, and operation, and reframes intelligence as an ongoing process of self-modification and world-coupling.

*Collective & multi-agent intelligence* — Intelligence scales through cooperation. Brains, societies, ecosystems, and multi-agent artificial systems all exhibit forms of collective intelligence grounded in modularity, mutual modeling, and division of labor. CIMC explores how intelligence emerges at multiple levels of organization, and how social, institutional, and multi-agent approaches can increase robustness, reduce computational costs, and reshape questions of alignment, governance, and ethics in systems composed of many interacting agents.

To learn more about the intellectual foundations of these paradigm shifts, see *Principles of Synthetic Intellience* by Joscha Bach. Many of the core ideas informing CIMC’s work are also explored in contemporary research on artificial life, predictive processing, morphogenesis, and the philosophy of mind.
